 * Public entry point for converting a Penpot shape to HTML — delegates to

 * the shared `data-name` / `data-penpot-locked` / `data-penpot-blocked`
 * attributes on every shape (including the recursive ones from
 * `shapes/frame.ts` and `shapes/group.ts`).
 *
 * Component instances (shapes with `componentId`) are rendered identically to
 * their underlying type — live component sync is not supported; instances are
 * treated as static HTML.
 *
 * Unknown shape types return an empty string.
